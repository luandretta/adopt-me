# Adopt-me!
Learn to build real-world applications using modern React 18.x+! Much more than an intro, you’ll start from the ground up, getting to using the latest features in React, including hooks, effects, context, and portals. Throughout the course, you’ll piece together tools from the entire React ecosystem (like Vite, ESLint, TailwindCSS, React Router, and React Query) to build a complete application to browse adoptable pets!
